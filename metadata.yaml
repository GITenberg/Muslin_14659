description: Hailed by Yeats as a masterpiece, this 1886 novel sheds light on the
  Anglo-Irish marriage market. Moore offers a satiric yet sympathetic look at five
  unmarried daughters of the Anglo-Irish gentry and details their desperate antics
  to locate suitable husbands. Written with vivid and rich attention to period details,
  the book is a prime example of Moore's innate ability to grasp women's issues.
